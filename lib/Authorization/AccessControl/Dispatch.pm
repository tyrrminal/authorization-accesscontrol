=head1 NAME

Authorization::AccessControl::Dispatch - Dispatch result/status appropriately 
following ACL request yield

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Authorization::AccessControl::Dispatch;

  my $dispatch = Authorization::AccessControl::Dispatch->new(
    granted => 1,
    entity => 'some secure value');

  $dispatch->denied(...); # not called
  $dispatch->null(...); # not called
  $dispatch->granted(sub($val) { $c->render(text => $val) }); # renders value

  $request->yield(sub(){...})
    ->granted(sub($val) { #handle success 
    })
    ->denied(sub() { # handle denial
    })
    ->null(sub() { # handle not found
    })

Handlers can be repeated:

  $request->yield(sub(){...})
    ->granted(sub($value){ $c->render(json => $value) })
    ->granted(\&write_audit_log)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a lightweight class that simply facilitates a "promise-style" callback
interface for dealing with the result of 
L<yield|Authorization::AccessControl::Request/yield> in 
C<Authorization::AccessControl::Request>

Dispatch instances are immutable: none of their properties may be altered after
object creation.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  Authorization::AccessControl::Dispatch->new(granted => [0|1|undef], entity => ...)

Creates a new Dispatch instance. C<granted> is a trinary value reflecting the
request status: "truthy" indicates permitted, "falsy" indicates denied, and
undefined indicates that necessary attributes could not be evaluated because the
data value was not present. C<entity> is the data value, to be passed to 
L</granted> handlers. If C<granted> is anything but "truthy", the C<entity> 
value is immediately undefined before proceeding.

=head2 granted

  $dispatch->granted(sub($result){...})

Registers a handler to be executed when the request is permitted by the ACL. 
Handler receives one argument: the 
L<yield|Authorization::AccessControl::Request/yield>ed value

Repeatable. Chainable.

=head2 denied

  $dispatch->denied(sub(){...})

Registers a handler to be executed when the request is denied by the ACL. 
Handler receives no arguments.

Repeatable. Chainable.

=head2 null

  $dispatch->null(sub(){ ... })

Registers a handler to be executed when the 
L<yield|Authorization::AccessControl::Request/yield>ed value is undefined. 
Handler receives no arguments.

Repeatable. Chainable.

=head2 is_granted

  $dispatch->is_granted()

Returns a boolean value reflecting whether or not the request was permitted by 
the ACL
